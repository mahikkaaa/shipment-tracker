#Shipment-Tracker - initial set up of the project

Day 1
made a repository in my local - shipment-tracker, done cd
added backend and frontend folders in the same repository
also added a readme file "Smart shipment tracker"

git init - initialised git repository - created a new, empty git repository inside the shipment-tracker project folder - this adds a hidden .git folder to track changes 


git remote add origin https://github.com/mahikkaaa/shipment-tracker.git 
I linked my local git repository to a remote one on GitHub
this remote is called origin and it points to my GitHub repository url

I created a README.md file using echo. >
echo. > README.md


echo "# Smart Shipment Tracker" >> README.md
This appends "#Smart Shipping Tracker" to the README.md file and the >> operator appends text to the file {NOTE: if i would use >, it would overwrite}

git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
Here git add . - stages all files in the folder and commit is used to commit all staged files with a message 

git push -u origin master
pushing my commit to the master branch - which failed so i renamed my local branch from master to main {git branch -M main}, and then pushed to main branch - git push -u origin main 
This failed again because my remote branch had commits my local branch didn't have to i was needed to pull first to sync 

So i did a pull 
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
this pulled remote changes and tried to merge them with local repo 
the flag {--allow-unrelated-histories} allowed merging two separate project histories and i got a merge conflict in README.md because the remote and local README differed


Created nested directories manually in windows, i used windows style backslashes {\} to create nested folders one by one
mkdir src\main\java\com\mahika\shipmenttracker\controller
similar to controller folder, i created model (folder for model classes like data entities), repository (folder for repository classes like handling data access) and service (folder to service classes for business logic layer)


Created empty files using the echo. command 
ShipmentTrackerApplication - spring boot application file for backend java project
pom.xml - maven project configuration file that manages dependencies and build settings for java project

touch filename - creates empty file (Linux only)	but Not available on Windows CMD
type nul > filename - creates truly empty file
echo. > filename - Creates 1 blank line	
echo filename - prints the name of the file, more like a print statement


Pre-requisite for Backend

before starting to work on backend, i made sure all required tools are installed 
Java 11+ -> java --version
Node.js -> node -v && npm -v
aws cli -> aws --version, aws configure 

AWS CLI Installation
https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
"Windows (64-bit)" installer under Version 2.

AWS Configuration
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
Default output format [None]: json

How to get Access Key ID & Secret Access Key
- Go to the AWS Console → https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- Navigate to IAM → Users → click your username.
- Go to the Security Credentials tab.
- Scroll to Access Keys → Click Create access key
- Select “Application running outside AWS” → Click Next
- Copy: AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key

Installation and Configuration of Maven on Windows
- https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- "Binary zip archive" version (e.g., apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip)
- extract zip
- add Maven to System Path -> Windows + S -> Search environment variables -> click on "Edit the system environment variables" -> click Environment Variables -> Under System Variables find "Path" and click edit -> click new and paste bin path "C:\Users\Mahika Agrawal\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.10-bin\apache-maven-3.9.10\bin" ->Also add a new system variable (Variable name : MAVEN_HOME, Variable Value : C:\Users\Mahika Agrawal\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.10-bin\apache-maven-3.9.10)
- Verify the installation : mvn -v

Backend
Implementing the backend logic for creating and fetching shipments using Spring Boot.
- model/Shipment.java
	{cd backend/src/main/java/com/mahika/shipmenttracker/
	mkdir model
	cd model
	notepad Shipment.java}
- repository/ShipmentRepository.java
- service/ShipmentService.java
- controller/ShipmentController.java
- shipmenttracker/ShipmentTrackerApplication.java (main application file)
- added project details and dependencies in pom.xml
- resources/application.properties

run the app -> mvn spring-boot:run

check post and get request in postman desktop
